Hey there! My name is Ajay and I am a student who is passionate about all things
tech and math related. I am currently studying at UChicago pursuing two degrees
in math and computer science. I originally entered college intending only to major
in pure mathematics. However, in my second year I took an introductory computer science course
and my love for tech and engineering was unlocked.

As a budding software engineer, my overarching goal is to build products that serve
to improve the lives of the people who use them. Whether it's cutting edge autonomous vehicle
technology or a simple web app that reduces time spent doing tedious tasks, I always look
forward to getting my hands dirty and doing the best work I can.
